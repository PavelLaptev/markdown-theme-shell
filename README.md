## Motivation

Often, while working on a design system or other design-documents, we have to keep detailed documentation. This is useful not only for structuring existing files, but it **becomes a single source of truth** that not only designers, but also managers and developers look at. And there is a need for collective file editing.

But how to file such a document? For this purpose, the “Markdown Theme Shell” was made, it parses the markdown file in the HTML page, creating a sidebar and content area. Wrapped up markdown file **looks more representable** than a pure MD file. You can store it on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) or other any server.
